# Project Management

A lot of things can be done using GitHub alone, so at first you don't need more.
But of course there are some extensions like [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
or [zube](https://zube.io/) which can also be used.

In GitHub this is done using the Issues and the additional Project tab.


## Setup

### Create a new project

Each repository can have multiple projects. You only need a Title and description
to create a new one. After that it should be empty.

### Add columns

The project view comes in form of a Kanban board like often used in Agile Development
and tools like Jira, Trello...

Therefore you have to define your columns. A good starting point will be to
name them.

Simply:
- Waiting
- In Progress
- Done

Agile:
- Backlog
- Ready
- In Progress
- Test
- QA
- Done

### Cards

Within each column you can add cards and drag+drop them between the columns to show
the current state. You have two possibilities of cards:

__Notes__

This are simple information or tasks which only consists of an title. They are only
visible here and can be converted to issues as needed.

__Issues__

That are some real tasks with lots of possibilities:
- More details
- Possible discussion
- Pull Requests
- and more
