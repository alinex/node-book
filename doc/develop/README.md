# Development Environment

To start developing in good quality a lot of things are needed. Nothing good is
coded just out of thin air. But at first you need:
- Editor
- Version Control System
- Build System

And to really organize everything there are a lot of other tools which will help
you to organize and do all the things around the real coding. This tasks are:
- Project management
- Issues and reporting
- Continuous Integration
- Code analysis
- Documentation
- Publishing
- Dependency checking

I picked out some tools which work good together to do all these steps. Read on to get
a short introduction for all of them together with the specific steps to make them
work for the Alinex development.
