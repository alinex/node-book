# ES.Next JavaScript

At the moment I already write new code in the upcoming new language
standards like ES6 and newer...

ES6 also known as ECMAScript 2015 adds significant new syntax for writing complex
applications, including classes and modules. Other new features include iterators
and for/of loops, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions,
binary data, typed arrays, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, number
and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies.

ES7 also known as ECMAScript 2016 adds only two new functionalities:
- `Array.prototype.includes`
- Exponentiation Operator

All the other proposal not included in any current standards are defined in 5 stages:
- Stage 0 - Strawman: just an idea, possible Babel plugin.
- Stage 1 - Proposal: this is worth working on.
- Stage 2 - Draft: initial spec.
- Stage 3 - Candidate: complete spec and initial browser implementations.
- Stage 4 - Finished: will be added to the next yearly release.

ES8 officially named ECMAScript 2017 may offer:
- `Object.values`/`Object.entries`
- String padding
- `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors`
- Trailing commas in function parameter lists and calls
- Async Functions using async/await

- [ES6 Learning tutorial](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/)
- [Async/await](http://stackabuse.com/node-js-async-await-in-es7/)

Browser and server support for ES2015 is still incomplete but it can be transpiled
into ES5 code to work (see below).

Within the newer Alinex modules we start support at Node V 6 and also use some of
the upcoming features like async/await but not all proposals.


## Babel

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is a JavaScript compiler which will take modern JavaScript
code and transpile them into an older language using transformations and polyfills.
Essentially this makes the code runable in an environment which didn't support
the newest JavaScript standards.

To see what babel will do try it out in the online [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/).
ItÂ´s an interactive online playground that shows you how babel will translate your
code using different presets. But you can also use the `babel-node` CLI which comes
with an REPL like node itself to run code interactively on your local machine.

For the Alinex modules this is used to already use the newest language features
while also get it working today.

### Installation

First you need to install Babel CLI within your project as development requirement
and you will also need some additional presets:

First you have to decide what babel should transform. The rules defines a range of possibilities
which are transformed down till a specific version to run.

__Node 6 with support till stage-3__

```bash
$ npm install babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-3 babel-polyfill --save-dev
```

To make it usable you also have to add a configuration file `.babelrc` in your project
root and specify the installed presets to be used:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", { "targets": { "node": 6 } }],
    "stage-3"
  ],
  "plugins": [],
  "comments": false
}
```

__Older NodeJS support all proposals__

```bash
$ npm install babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-0 babel-polyfill --save-dev
```

To make it usable you also have to add a configuration file `.babelrc` in your project
root and specify the installed presets to be used:

```json
{
  "presets": ["es2015", "stage-0"],
  "plugins": [],
  "comments": false
}
```

### Usage

Now you can integrate babel with your project by defining it's call in the scripts
section of `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node_modules/.bin/babel-node src/index.js --require babel-polyfill",
    "build": "babel src -d dist --require babel-polyfill",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "prepublish": "npm run build"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=6"
  }  
}
```

Also specify the engines information to help people use your module in the right version.

This defines the babel transformation to:
1. Be used as JIT compiler in dev mode (run using `npm run dev`)
2. Be converted into ES5 code by running `npm run build` (into `dist` folder)
3. Everything in dist folder can be used without babel
4. Before publishing to npm the `build` command is called automatically

The babel polyfills are needed to use the async/await which will come with
node 7.6.


## Flow

[Flow](https://flow.org) is a static type checker which checks your code for errors
through static type annotations. These types allows to tell Flow how you want your
code to work, and Flow will make sure it does work that way.

```js
// @flow
function square(n: number): number {
  return n * n // normally the error is here
}

square("2") // with flow it is reported here
```

### Installation

This can be setup as extension to babel which will strip of the flow definition on
transpiling:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev flow-bin flow-typed babel-preset-flow
$ npm run flow init
$ sudo npm install flow-bin # needed for some IDEs
$ node_modules/.bin/flow-typed install # will download your libraries
```

Also you have to add the preset `flow` to babel. Now the compiler will strip off
all flow extensions and the builded code will work as if it was never there.

After adding new modules you should update your flow-typed libraries:

```bash
$ node_modules/.bin/flow-typed install --overwrite
```

### Usage

To take advantage of the flow checking you run it using:

```bash
$ npm run flow
# or if installed globally
$ flow
```

This command may be run automatically from the `test` or `dev` task. And some editors
like Atom can directly validate and show problems while editing, now.
