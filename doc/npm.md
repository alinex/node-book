# Package Repository

As we are here in the NodeJS world there is not really a choice. The NPM is the only
repository used here. But it can be used using the default `npm` tool or the more modern
and optimized `yarn` tool.

After the first package was released you can also use a badge on your `README.md` like:

``` markdown
[![npm package](
  https://img.shields.io/npm/v/alinex-rest.svg?maxAge=86400&label=latest%20version)](
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/alinex-rest)
[![latest version](
  https://img.shields.io/npm/l/alinex-rest.svg?maxAge=86400)](#license)
```
