# Alinex NodeJS Modules

This is a book explaining all the major parts and development background around
the Alinex namespaced modules.

Keep in mind that some of the modules use an older standard but will eventually
be upgraded to this. It is also not a real hard fact but a definition which may
change as the world around changes. Nobody needs to do it this way but it helps
for all which are working deeply with the Alinex modules and participating to it
to understand the parts behind.


## Basics

All the different modules in the Alinex namespace are loose coupled but optimal
integrated. In the first line they solve my own problems
but I will enlarge their functionality and often my problems are the problems of
others, too.

The key concepts are "Configuration over Implementation" and "Keep it Simple".

You will find a [list of modules](modules.md) which are notable within this documentation.
