## Type Annotations

For strict type checking use [type annotations](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/).


## Coding Style

The following rules defines the basics which are derived from the
[Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md).
If configured the linter (see more under [Testing](test.md)) will ensure that these
rules are followed.

A compact list of the essential rules are:
- avoid using `var`
- literal object creation
- use object method shorthand
- use property shorthand
- use single quote strings
- use template strings
