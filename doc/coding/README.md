# Coding

This chapter contains general and specific rules to write the code which the
Alinex modules try to follow. It's not a standard but a guideline.

Also described are some tools which are directly used in coding like linter, testing
and package management.

> Fast prototyping is something which is great at first sight, but to fast may

> Therefor start slow, decide well and sometimes look back and maybe correct

That's the way I try to do the Alinex modules, documenting my decisions.
