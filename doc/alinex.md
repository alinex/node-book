# What is Alinex?

Just now it is a modular, flexible and powerful tool set for applications mostly
in the backend but also in frontend. It aims to help the developer to create
individual solutions in a fast and easy but stable way.

It is used in production for IT operations and maintenance.


## Why I created it?

As I got more into the concept of NodeJS I found out that this is the ideal
solution for the Alinex platform. I use this project to check new technologies
out and hopefully bring it more on the way than my PHP server part just now.

I worked further on creating a modular system with some of the great modules
available. Hardest thing is to find the best module for each job out of the
great repository.
With this project I went to new land (for me) in the web technologies and tried
lots of the current propagated technologies and patterns out.


## Language Decision

As always the world is neither black nor white but something between and everybody
sees it his way. You may decide other than I and the NodeJS language is neither
always the best but I love the rapid prototyping and package management of it.

I am using ES6 or CoffeeScript here but all modules will be transformed into pure
JavaScript before releasing them. So you have no need to use the newest V8 or
CoffeeScript if you include one of the Alinex modules.

If the performance would be higher rated as the fast prototyping I would have
decided to use Rust.


## Relations

The Alinex modules often have a strong relation to the
[config](http://alinex.github.io/node-config) and
[validator](http://alinex.github.io/node-validator) modules but don't be alarmed
you don't have to use only the Alinex modules and they are usable also outside
the Alinex namespace.


## Roadmap

There is no real roadmap for the time and functionality. It all depends on my
personal time and interests. But I will give a short overview of the big
points, what is planned for this year (2017):

- modernize some modules using ES6
- REST Server implementation
- Universal frontend applications

See the [Planning Board](https://trello.com/b/lOY5hCx7/node-js) for more up to
date information of there I'm working at now and what may be planned.
