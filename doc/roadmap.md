# Roadmap

There is no real roadmap for the time and functionality. It all depends on my
personal time and interests.


## Long Term

As this is a learning project I am not considered to go in a specific direction
in a given time. But I made some big goals for the current year 2017:
- modernize some modules using ES6
- REST Server implementation
- Universal front end applications

These are again framework steps to make something out of which to build real applications.
Maybe some real applications will evolve beside these, at least to test that everything
works, too.


## Planning Board

To decide which big EPIC project to do I use a Trello [Planning Board](https://trello.com/b/lOY5hCx7/node-js).

Look into it to get information about the Alinex projects which will be developed and
also see the state of others. From time to time my decisions there will change.

More details to each project may be found by the associated GitHub planning boards.
See the details on each card.
